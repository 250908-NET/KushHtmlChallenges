    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kush. I graduated from Northern Illinois University with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and am currently a Full Stack .NET Developer at Revature. 
        I’m passionate about backend development and database systems, continuously expanding my skills to become a strong Software Engineer. Through my Revature training, 
        I’ve gained hands-on experience building RESTful APIs with Test-Driven Development, while my previous internship allowed me to work on projects using SQL, HTML/CSS, and Python, and present technical insights effectively. 
        I enjoy solving complex problems by creating scalable and efficient solutions—whether developing modular APIs or optimizing IoT devices—and 
        I’m committed to continuous learning and contributing to innovative, collaborative software teams.</p>
